This repository contains the work and outputs of Work Package 10 – “From Text to Code” within the project “Artificial Intelligence for Official Statistics (AIML4OS)” ([link]{https://cros.ec.europa.eu/dashboard/aiml4os}). 

WP10 aims to explore and apply AI/ML methodologies to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of classification and coding processes used by National Statistical Institutes (NSIs).

This repository serves as a guide and entry point to all resources and outputs generated by WP10. It is intended primarily for National Statistical Institutes, both within and outside the AIML4OS project.

To explore these resources, please visit the dedicated [Github Webpage](https://AIML4OS.github.io/WP10_template_quarto_python_test/). 

Special thanks to our colleagues from the [Work Package 6 "Knowledge repository and training materials"](https://cros.ec.europa.eu/book-page/aiml4os-wp6-knowledge-repository-and-training-materials) for providing this tutorial [template](https://github.com/AIML4OS/AIML4OS-template-quarto-python).
