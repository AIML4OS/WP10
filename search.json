    "text": "Share your code through the AIML4OS Github Organization\nAll WP10 outputs are made available under the AIML4OS GitHub Organization, through the dedicated “WP10” Team.\n\nGithub Access\nTo contribute, you must be therefore a member of the WP10 Team within the AIML4OS GitHub Organization. If you are not yet a member, please contact the WP10 Leader to request access.\n\n\nRepository Creation\nDepending on your contribution, you may:\n\nContribute to an existing WP10 repository, or\nRequest the creation of a new repository.\n\nIf you need a new repository, please reach out to the WP10 Leader and provide the following information:\n\nCluster name: the WP10 cluster you wish to contribute to.\n\nRepository name: following this naming convention:\nWP10_ClusterX_NamePipelineY\n\nIf you wish to provide a GitHub Page and/or link your code to an Onyxia containerized service, that’s great!\nInform the WP10 Leader, who will create the new repository using one of the official templates provided by WP6:\n\nTemplate for training material in Quarto for R\n\nTemplate for training material in Quarto for Python\n\nFor detailed guidance on using these templates, please refer to the Training Material Starting Pack and its source code.\n\n\nPush your code\nWhen contributing to an existing repository, please follow these best practices:\n\nCreate a new branch from the main branch.\n\nCommit your changes to this new branch.\n\nSubmit a pull request (PR) to merge your branch into the main branch.\n\nBefore merging:\n\nRequest a review from another contributor in your cluster.\n\nApply any necessary changes based on their feedback.\n\nMerge only after receiving explicit approval.\n\n⚠️ Always follow the “four-eyes principle” — every PR should be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging. This helps maintain code quality and prevents merge conflicts.\n\n\nQuality Guidelines\nWP10 defined quality guidelines to structure our work, especially the code shared through Github.\nPlease refer to this guidelines presented within the template Quality Gates Template for WP10 Outputs\n\n\nData Sharing\nWP10 delivers pipelines and datasets to support runnable and reproducible workflows. Where possible, trained model objects are also shared. When sharing complete input datasets is not feasible, small representative samples are provided instead.\nAll data is stored on Onyxia’s system, within a dedicated WP10 bucket with restricted access for WP10 members.\nWP10 members can upload their datasets and manage access permissions to share data through a publicly accessible URL. For detailed guidance on this matter, please refer to the “Data Storage in WP10” guidelines\n\nTo upload data to the WP10 bucket, you must first register on Onyxia and then contact the WP10 Leader.\nPlease include your Onyxia username so that access can be granted.\n\n\n⚠️ Be careful: Do not share any sensitive or confidential data.",

    "text": "WP10 Goals\nWork Package 10 “Text to code” (WP10) addresses one of the most persistent challenges in official statistics: the classification of free-text data — such as job titles or household expenditures — into standardized statistical codes like ISCO, COICOP, and NACE. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) methods offer significant potential to enhance statistical classification and coding, particularly in contexts where large datasets and complex categorical structures make manual coding inefficient.\nHowever, the diversity of data sources — varying in language, structure, and national adaptations — makes developing a single universal solution nearly impossible.\nTo tackle this, WP10 brings together nine countries and four observers in a collaborative effort to overcome shared obstacles, including:\n\nLimited training data,\n\nLinguistic complexity and the diversity of statistical nomenclatures,\n\nMLOps deployment challenges, and\n\nFrequent revisions of classification systems.",

    "text": "WP10 Outputs\nWP10 aims to deliver a series of tangible outputs across two main phases.\n\nPhase 1: Understanding the Landscape — Projects Overview and Literature Reviews\nProjects Overview:\nDuring the first year, each participating NSI presented its ongoing work on text classification, enabling WP10 to gain a comprehensive overview of how this topic is currently being approached across institutions, and what challenges are commonly encountered.\nThese presentations are accessible on Github (link). A synthesis of these presentations — identifying shared priorities, differences, and common obstacles — has been compiled in the Landscape Document (link coming soon).\nLiterature Reviews:\nBuilding on this initial mapping, WP10 identified five key challenges and conducted five corresponding literature reviews. These reviews serve as the foundational groundwork before moving into the experimental phase.\nAll reviews are accessible here: Literature Reviews (link).\n\n\n\nPhase 2: Exploring Solutions — Experiments and Pipeline Implementations\nBased on insights from Phase 1, WP10 identified five thematic clusters to structure the experimental work.\nEach cluster focuses on one of the main challenges NSIs face, exploring and implementing possible solutions collaboratively.\nRather than enforcing a single unified pipeline, the project aims to document and share a variety of approaches, enabling each NSI to tailor solutions to its specific national and operational context.\nThe clusters’ reports will be made available here: clusters reports (link). All experimental code and resources are available through GitHub repositories linked in the cluster sections below.",
