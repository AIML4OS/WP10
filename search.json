    "text": "WP10 Goals\nWork Package 10 “Text to code” (WP10) addresses one of the most persistent challenges in official statistics: the classification of free-text data — such as job titles or household expenditures — into standardized statistical codes like ISCO, COICOP, and NACE. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) methods offer significant potential to enhance statistical classification and coding, particularly in contexts where large datasets and complex categorical structures make manual coding inefficient.\nHowever, the diversity of data sources — varying in language, structure, and national adaptations — makes developing a single universal solution nearly impossible.\nTo tackle this, WP10 brings together nine countries and four observers in a collaborative effort to overcome shared obstacles, including:\n\nLimited training data,\n\nLinguistic complexity and the diversity of statistical nomenclatures,\n\nMLOps deployment challenges, and\n\nFrequent revisions of classification systems.",

    "text": "WP10 Outputs\nWP10 aims to deliver a series of tangible outputs across two main phases.\n\nPhase 1: Understanding the Landscape — Projects Overview and Literature Reviews\nProjects Overview:\nDuring the first year, each participating NSI presented its ongoing work on text classification, enabling WP10 to gain a comprehensive overview of how this topic is currently being approached across institutions, and what challenges are commonly encountered.\nThese presentations are accessible on Github (link). A synthesis of these presentations — identifying shared priorities, differences, and common obstacles — has been compiled in the Landscape Document (link coming soon).\nLiterature Reviews:\nBuilding on this initial mapping, WP10 identified five key challenges and conducted five corresponding literature reviews. These reviews serve as the foundational groundwork before moving into the experimental phase.\nAll reviews are accessible here: Literature Reviews (link).\n\n\n\nPhase 2: Exploring Solutions — Experiments and Pipeline Implementations\nBased on insights from Phase 1, WP10 identified five thematic clusters to structure the experimental work.\nEach cluster focuses on one of the main challenges NSIs face, exploring and implementing possible solutions collaboratively.\nRather than enforcing a single unified pipeline, the project aims to document and share a variety of approaches, enabling each NSI to tailor solutions to its specific national and operational context.\nThe clusters’ reports will be made available here: clusters reports (link). All experimental code and resources are available through GitHub repositories linked in the cluster sections below.",
