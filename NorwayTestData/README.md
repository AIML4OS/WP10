# Data location
The data is saved as parquet files in the s3 folder `projet-aiml4os-wp10/NorwayData`.
The training and test data can be read using the following python code:
```
import os
import s3fs
import pandas as pd

S3_ENDPOINT_URL = "https://" + os.environ["AWS_S3_ENDPOINT"]
fs = s3fs.S3FileSystem(client_kwargs={'endpoint_url': S3_ENDPOINT_URL})

filpath_train = "projet-aiml4os-wp10/NorwayData/train_norwaydata.parquet"
with fs.open(filpath_train, mode="rb") as file_in:
    train = pd.read_parquet(file_in)

filpath_test = "projet-aiml4os-wp10/NorwayData/test_norwaydata.parquet"
with fs.open(filpath_test, mode="rb") as file_in:
    test = pd.read_parquet(file_in)
```
